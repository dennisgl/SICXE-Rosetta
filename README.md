SICXE-Rosetta
=========================

[SIC/SICXE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Instructional_Computer) is a assembly language for academic uses.
It is introduced in System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming, by Leland Beck.

Surprisingly, the language has been served as a teaching material of assembly introduction lectures for a considerable time.

**SICXE-Rosetta** is an assembler for SICXE, put it simply, to turn SICXE into machine codes.

##Correctness

Unfortunately, this is a uncompleted project, which means the correctness of the SICXE compiling 
would not be guaranteed.

##Contribution

+ It is welcome to fork and to make modifications to improve this work,
the pull request would be accepted right away.

+ If you have your own version of SICXE assembler, it is encouraged to create your own project.
Instead, I would like to include your work if you prefer not to create your own repo; send me a pull request as well in this case.
